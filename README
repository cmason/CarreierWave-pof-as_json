## json export troubles with carrierwave 0.6.x

When there are two mount_uploader into a model (see User),
and we upload a file, it doesn't appear into the json.


## Running tests

Run "rspec spec" in a terminal to see that there is a bug with the User model
that doesn't exist with the UserWorking model.

## The problem

When we upload a file (like rails.png) in an instance of UserWorkin?

> irb(main):001:0>     u = UserWorking.new
> => #<UserWorking id: nil, username: nil, avatar: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
> irb(main):002:0>     u.avatar = File.open(Rails.root + 'app/assets/images/rails.png')
> => #<File:/private/tmp/my-project/app/assets/images/rails.png>
> irb(main):003:0>     u.save!
> => true
> irb(main):004:0> u.avatar
> => /uploads/user_working/avatar/2/rails.png
> irb(main):005:0> u.as_json
> => {"avatar"=>{"url"=>"/uploads/user_working/avatar/2/rails.png", :thumb=>{"url"=>"/uploads/user_working/avatar/2/thumb_rails.png"}}, "created_at"=>Tue, 10 Jul 2012 15:47:40 UTC +00:00, "id"=>2, "updated_at"=>Tue, 10 Jul 2012 15:47:40 UTC +00:00, "username"=>nil}
