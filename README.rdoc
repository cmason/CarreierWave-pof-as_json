== json export troubles with carrierwave 0.6.x

When there are two mount_uploader into a model (see User),
and we upload a file, it doesn't appear into the json.


== Running tests

Run _rspec spec_ in a terminal to see that there is a bug with the User model
that doesn't exist with the UserWorking model.

See _spec/models/user_spec.rb_ and _spec/models/user_working_spec.rb_ for details.
